      Agra is a city in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, located on
      the banks of the Yamuna River. It is most famous for being the home of the
      Taj Mahal, one of the most iconic buildings in the world. Here are some
      other places that are worth visiting in Agra: <br />
      Taj Mahal: This white marble mausoleum was built by Mughal Emperor Shah
      Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. It is considered one of
      the greatest examples of Mughal architecture and attracts millions of
      visitors each year. <br />
      <b>Agra Fort: </b> This impressive fortress was the residence of the
      Mughal emperors until 1638. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and offers
      a stunning view of the Taj Mahal from its ramparts. <br />
      <b>Fatehpur Sikri:</b>
      This abandoned city was the capital of the Mughal Empire for just 14 years
      in the late 16th century. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and
      features a number of well-preserved buildings, including the stunning Jama
      Masjid mosque. <br />
      <b> Itmad-ud-Daula:</b>
      Also known as the Baby Taj, this beautiful tomb is made of white marble
      and was built by Empress Nur Jahan for her father. It is smaller than the
      Taj Mahal, but still features intricate inlay work and beautiful gardens.
      <br />
      <b>Mehtab Bagh:</b>
      This garden is located across the Yamuna River from the Taj Mahal and
      offers a stunning view of the monument at sunset. <br />
      <b>Akbar's Tomb:</b>
      This beautiful tomb was built for the Mughal Emperor Akbar and features a
      blend of Hindu, Islamic, and Christian architectural styles. <br />
      <b>Mughal Heritage Walk:</b>
      This guided walking tour takes visitors through the streets of Agra to
      explore the city's rich history and culture. <br />
      <b>Kinari Bazaar:</b>
      This bustling market is a great place to shop for souvenirs, textiles,
      jewelry, and other handicrafts.
